// Notes:
//
// - The file must be saved using utf-8 without signature (adv save options)
//
// - Translations should generally be a similar or shorter length to the original text (although if there's lots of text - like the help - it doesn't matter). If necessary a shorter but less "correct" phrase may be better.
//
// - Be careful to preserve certain things like:
//     "..." at the end of a phrase
//     Things like %d (which are used to insert numbers into the string)
//     Spaces in multi-line strings
//     The ordering
//
// - Use accents etc like ü instead of ue, except in PS_DONATEMSG
//
// - Translate in place - replacing the original English. If you can't think of a good translation, skip it.
//
// - Try to be consistent - so if you use "controller" in one place, don't use "transmitter" in other places.
// 
// - It's probably more important to get the first half (down to "Everything below here is for settings") translated - these will be seen by people even if they don't fiddle with the settings.
//
// - Let me know if you see a typo in the English

  txt[PS_HOWTOFLYTEXT] = 
"The first thing to do is to visit the website (link below) and watch the short video \"How to Fly\". \n"
"\n"
"When the simulator starts it will be paused. The button in the top right corner will unpause it, "
"sending the glider off flying into the wind. You need to use the on-screen joystick/controller in "
"the bottom right hand corner of the screen to control it - just like the right-hand stick of a "
"radio-control transmitter (set up in Mode 2). When you crash, either use the back button on your "
"device to reset the glider, or pause the simulator, tap the 'rewind' button, and unpause it again.\n"
"\n"
"Once you've got the hang of the basic controls, you need to manoever the glider so that it stays within "
"the region of lift provided by the wind as it flows up and over the hill. The best way to do this (at "
"first) is to fly straight ahead for a three or four seconds, then turn left and fly parallel to the hill "
"for up to about ten seconds. Then turn round and fly back a similar distance past the viewpoint, keeping "
"parallel to the hill and at about the same height as the viewpoint.\n"
"\n"
"If you find things happen too fast, you can try slowing down time in the Settings»Options panel. Remember "
"to set it back to 1.0 when you've got the hang of things though - there isn't one of these settings in "
"real life!\n"
"\n"
"If you're not using one of the panoramic sceneries, you can also change the viewpoint to inside the aeroplane "
"(the 'eye' button when paused, or the 'search' "
"button on your device). Now you can explore the terrain - gaining lift where you can to try to cross areas "
"where the wind/hill doesn't provide any lift. Use the wind arrow to see which direction the wind is blowing in "
"and therefore where lift is likely to be found.\n"
"\n"
"If the terrain is essentially flat it will have been set up to enable thermals, and gliders will be given "
"a winch/bungee start. You'll need to watch the motion of the glider carefully to detect where the thermals "
"are. If you find this difficult, enable the thermal markers in the options - this will display birds flying "
"around in the core of the thermals. Remember "
"that thermals will be stronger over the land than over water, and also stronger around slopes that face the sun.\n"
"\n"
"Many planes will use the second controller to control the rudder. Up/down movements will control the throttle, flaps "
"or air brakes (as appropriate) - look how the control surfaces move to see.\n"
"\n"
"Visit the website below to see some videos showing how to fly - it takes some practice, just like with a "
"real radio controlled aircraft!"
;

  txt[PS_HOWTOCONFIGURETEXT] = 
"You can access PicaSim settings from either the start menu, or using one of the buttons when paused.\n"
"\n"
"The settings are split up into blocks - general options, the aeroplane, the scenery/terrain, the lighting "
"and the controller configuration. By default you can't fiddle with the detailed individual settings for most of these "
"but you can load preset configuration blocks. This lets you quickly switch aeroplane or terrain, for example.\n"
"\n"
"If you enable the 'Advanced settings' in each section you'll get to tweak many more settings, which may be a little "
"daunting! In time there will be some information about these settings, but for now it's safe to tweak the values "
"as you can always reload them with one of the presets.\n"
"\n"
"You can save your presets - they get saved to the memory card/data area in your device. If you encounter problems with "
"PicaSim after changing the settings it may be worth reloading each section in turn immediately after starting PicaSim.\n"
"\n"
"If 'Walkabout' is enabled in the options you'll also have a 'walkabout' button when paused. This allows you to use the "
"controller to walk about the terrain, in order to find a new site to fly from. By default the wind direction is "
"automatically adjusted when in this mode (so it blows directly towards the camera).\n"
"\n"
"With panoramic sceneries it's not possible to change the viewpoint, so the walkabout mode is disabled."
;

  txt[PS_HOWTORACETEXT] = 
"Most challenge/race modes involve flying as fast as possible between checkpoints. The next checkpoint you need to aim for "
"is highlighted in colour, and is also pointed to by the white arrow at the bottom of the screen.\n"
"\n"
"There are different types of checkpoints: In the F3F-style races, where you have to fly multiple laps back and forth, "
"you need to fly past the checkpoint, upwind of it. In the cross-country race you just need to get close to the checkpoint (though "
"you can be as high as you like). In the Flatland race you fly between two gates - the active upwind gate is green, and the "
"downwind one is red.\n"
"\n"
"There are also duration modes where the aim is to keep flying for as long as possible using the thermals. Limbo "
"modes require you to fly below the gate as many times as possible (in the right direction!) in a given time. The gate can be "
"lowered in Settings»Options 2 which makes it harder, but you do get more points!\n"
;

  txt[PS_OBJECTEDITINGTEXT] = 
"PicaSim allows additional objects to be simulated and drawn, apart from the terrain and the plane (etc).\n"
"\n"
"In the Settings»Objects tab you can load a set of these objects - this is done automatically when loading a "
"scene. Most scenes will not include any objects. However, some panoramic scenes will to represent objects "
"that are not part of the ground.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to add objects to the scene, you can enable object editing in Settings»Objects. This will make a set of "
"on-screen buttons that let you create/delete objects, change the selection, and change their properties. When moving "
"them around, bear in mind that you can select to work in world space, relative to the camera, or relative to the space of "
"the object. After creating a set of objects, don't forget to save them!\n"
"\n"
"You can configure some additional properties like visibility and shadows in the Settings»Objects tab. From there you can "
"also force them to reset to their initial positions, by reloading the scene."
;

  txt[PS_TIPSTEXT] = 
"Here are some tips to help you get the most out of PicaSim:\n"
"\n"
"• Remember it's a simulator for radio-controlled planes - the primary focus is on realistic control, with the \"pilot\" standing on "
"the ground. Remember that learning to fly is a skill that needs practice - look on the website below for help.\n"
"\n"
"• Experiment with the settings, especially if you're a R/C pilot and have preferences! If you mess things up, immediately after "
"starting PicaSim go into settings and load a preset for the relevant sections.\n"
"\n"
"• If you experience any problems or have suggestions, email picasimulator@gmail.com\n"
"\n"
"• Panoramas can be displayed at \"normal\" and \"maximum\" detail - it's certainly worth trying the higher detail level, though if "
"PicaSim crashes when loading panoramic sceneries, try reducing the detail in Settings»Options 1.\n"
"\n"
"• AI controlled planes are configured in two places. Settings»Options 2 allows you to set what the maximum number of AI planes "
"your device will run. Settings»AI Controllers allows you to configure what planes will actually be loaded.\n";

  txt[PS_KEYBOARDTEXT] = 
"If you have a keyboard, there are some shortcuts:\n"
"\n"
"[r] - Relaunch\n"
"[p] - Toggle pause\n"
"[c] - Cycles through the camera views\n"
"[Right shift] - Press the \"rates\" button, if available\n"
"[s] - Write screenshot into the user data area\n"
"[t] - Toggle slow motion\n"
"[m] - Enter walkabout mode (if enabled)\n"
"[Arrow keys] - These can be mapped to control the plane\n"
"[Num-pad] - Move the plane (when paused). Use Ctrl to rotate\n"
"[Alt+Enter] - Toggle full-screen (Windows only)\n"
"[=] and [-] - Zoom in and out\n"
"[1] and [2] - Toggle the buttons (typically used for smoke)\n"

;

  txt[PS_JOYSTICKSETUPTEXT] = 
"PicaSim supports external USB joysticks/gamepads under Android 3.0 and above, and under Windows. On Android devices "
"this will require a USB OTG (On The Go) connector, and your device will need to support it - so please check that first. "
"If the joystick tab appears in the settings menus there's a good chance your device will support external USB controllers, "
"but it's not guaranteed!\n"
"\n"
"The external controller needs to be connected before running PicaSim, and under Windows it is recommended to calibrate the joystick using "
"the \"calibrate\" button in Settings»Joystick.\n"
"\n"
"If your joystick is detected and selected in Settings»Joystick you will need to assign physical inputs to the controls recognised by PicaSim. "
"This is done by identifying which joystick axis corresponds to which control input, and then there are buttons to press when the stick is "
"in the centre, to the left or down, and to the right or up. You can then check that the stick movements maps to the correct outputs. "
"This procedure is the same under Windows and Android - visit the website below for a video describing this in more detail."
